# Requirements Engineering with Trello and Jira

This document provides an overview of how Trello and Jira were used for managing the requirements for the Call Type Predictor project. It includes details about the setup of both tools, the categorization of tasks, and how these tasks were tracked and managed throughout the project lifecycle.

## Requirements Engineering with Trello

### Overview of Trello Board Setup

The Trello board for the Call Type Predictor project is designed to streamline the workflow and ensure all project requirements are met efficiently. The board is divided into several lists, representing different stages of task completion, from conception to completion.

### Trello Board Lists

1. **To Do**: Tasks that are identified and pending initiation.
2. **In Progress**: Tasks that are currently being worked on.
3. **Review**: Tasks awaiting review or approval.
4. **Done**: Tasks that have been completed.

### Using the Trello Board

Each task related to the project is represented as a card within these lists. Cards are moved from left to right as they progress through stages of completion. This visual representation helps track the progress of the project at a glance and ensures that all team members are aware of the task statuses.

### Example Requirements in Trello

1. **User Login Implementation**
   - **Description**: Develop a secure login system.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Successful login redirects to the dashboard; error message on failed login.
   - **Priority**: High

2. **Data Visualization Setup**
   - **Description**: Display real-time data visualizations.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Graphs and charts update every 5 seconds with the latest data.
   - **Priority**: Medium

3. **Model Training Module**
   - **Description**: Implement the machine learning model training component.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Model trains within a set time frame with a specified accuracy.
   - **Priority**: High

4. **Error Handling Mechanism**
   - **Description**: Implement comprehensive error handling throughout the system.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: System logs errors and displays user-friendly messages.
   - **Priority**: Medium

5. **User Registration Page**
   - **Description**: Create a user registration interface.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Users can register with valid email and strong password.
   - **Priority**: High

## Requirements Engineering with Jira

### Overview of Jira Project Setup

The Jira project for the Call Type Predictor is structured to manage and document all project requirements, tasks, and issues efficiently. Jira provides powerful tracking and reporting capabilities to ensure all requirements are met systematically.

### Jira Project Structure

1. **Epics**: High-level requirements or features.
2. **User Stories**: Smaller, manageable units of work that detail specific functionalities.
3. **Tasks**: Specific pieces of work that need to be completed.
4. **Bugs**: Issues or defects found during development.

### Using the Jira Project

Each requirement is documented as an issue in Jira, categorized under epics, user stories, tasks, or bugs. These issues are tracked through various stages such as Backlog, Selected for Development, In Progress, and Done. Jiraâ€™s powerful search and filter capabilities make it easy to track the progress and status of each requirement.

### Example Requirements in Jira

     - **Priority**: High

2. **Epic: Data Visualization**

   - **User Story: Real-time Graphs**
     - **Summary**: As a user, I want to see real-time data visualizations.
     - **Acceptance Criteria**: Graphs update every 5 seconds with the latest data.
     - **Priority**: Medium

3. **Epic: Machine Learning**

   - **Task: Implement Model Training**
     - **Summary**: Develop the module to train the machine learning model.
     - **Acceptance Criteria**: Model trains within 10 minutes with 90% accuracy.
     - **Priority**: High

4. **Epic: System Robustness**

   - **Task: Error Handling**
     - **Summary**: Implement error handling across the system.
     - **Acceptance Criteria**: Logs errors and shows user-friendly messages.
     - **Priority**: Medium

5. **Epic: User Management**
